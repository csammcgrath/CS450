# CS450
## Machine Learning and Data Mining course at BYU-Idaho

> For best results, clone this repository and run `cs450shell.py` inside W06 folder. It is able to execute all of the algorithms
list below. The R algorithms inside `cs450shell.py` has yet to be implemented. It will be a project of mine
after the semester is over.

> TODO:
> * [ ] Convert all .data file calls into csv files to be parsed through `read_csv()`
> * [ ] Clean up repository
> * [ ] Incorporate R algorithms into `cs450shell.py`

All of these algorithms are written from scratch through Python:
- W01 - Hardcoded Classifier ==> Main purpose: create an experimental shell for future Machine Learning algorithms.
- W02 - k-nearest-neighbors algorithm
- W03 - handle missing values in datasets while using k-nearest-neighbors to find results
- W04 - ID3 Decision Tree
- W06 - Neural Networks

These next algorithms were purely for experimentation with different Machine Learning algorithms through R.
- W07 - Support Vector Machine
- W09 - Apriori
